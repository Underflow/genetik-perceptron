Description
===========

This is an empiricist project to learn about ann and ga. I've never worked with neural networks and this is a first try.

The goal of this project is to implement a neural network which could be trained by a genetic algorithm (with a sufficient abstraction level to be usable to solve many kind of problems).

I will probably be reused to make a version using backpropagation as learning algorithm.
